# Recursive-Barbell
Recursive Barbell Trading Strategy, based on fractal risk taking. Inspired by the barbell strategy outlined by Nassim Taleb in his book series Incerto.


This strategy works by allocating 90% of funds to a "safe" allocation and 10% to a riskier portion.

Then from within that 10%, 90% To a relatively safer investment and 10% to a riskier portion.

This will continue in a fractal sense until the ceiling of the nth term is too small of an amount to divide further (set by user).

When inputting strategies under the framework of a recursive barbell one should increase the risk of the instrument exponentially, as to leverage positive black swan profits. 

This will most likely lead to many small loses, but when you win; due to the exponential risk curve; you should win big. 


### TODO List

-Proof of concept
- GUI
- Utilizing the strategy of the recursive barbell for other subject areas.
